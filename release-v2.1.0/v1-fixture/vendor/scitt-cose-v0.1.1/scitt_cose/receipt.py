"""COSE Receipt build (primitive) + verify.

A *Receipt* is a COSE_Sign1, signed by a transparency log, whose payload is the
Merkle tree root and whose unprotected header carries a *verifiable data proof*
(vdp) — here an RFC 9162 SHA-256 inclusion proof for one leaf. This is the
plumbing a transparency service would emit; operating such a service (a hosted
registration endpoint) is **out of scope** for this library, but the primitive
to mint and to verify a Receipt is included.

Encoding (tracks draft-ietf-cose-merkle-tree-proofs-18):

* protected header:
    * label ``1``   = alg code point (signed by the log key)
    * label ``395`` = verifiable-data-structure (vds); ``1`` = RFC9162_SHA256
* unprotected header:
    * label ``396`` = verifiable-data-proofs (vdp) map; key ``-1``
      ("inclusion proofs") -> array of inclusion-proof bstrs
* payload = the Merkle root bytes (detached by default; supplied by the verifier
  out of band, or attached)

Each inclusion-proof bstr is ``cbor([tree_size, leaf_index, [audit_path bstrs]])``.

The vds value is read from the **protected** header only (it is security-relevant
and must be integrity-protected by the signature). See the README for the honest
caveat that this vdp shape tracks the draft and is validated here by round-trip,
not against a frozen RFC.
